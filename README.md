# 🤖 ML_PRACTICE Repository

This repository contains my **Machine Learning practice notebooks** and projects.  
It is a collection of different algorithms, models, and data analysis techniques that I practiced while learning ML.

## 📂 Contents
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
- Naive Bayes
- Clustering (KMeans, Hierarchical)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cross-validation & Model Evaluation

## 🎯 Purpose
- To practice ML algorithms step by step  
- To maintain a record of my learning journey  
- To make it easy to revisit concepts with code examples  

## 🚀 Tools & Libraries
- Python 🐍  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas, Numpy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## ✨ Next Steps
- Add Deep Learning practice (TensorFlow / PyTorch)  
- Add small ML projects  
- Improve visualization and documentation
